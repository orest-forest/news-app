Application site to display world news using React, Redux and Router. API what i use is http://newsapi.org/.

# H1 General functionality:
⋅⋅*Authenticate user (login + logout button on profile page)
⋅⋅*Site have 4 clickable pages
⋅⋅*Takes latest world news

At the moment, the link with my aplication https://orest-forest.github.io/news-app/ is not work. Due to the prohibition of the use of news images. But there is a possibility of local launch.

# H1 To get the frontend running locally:

⋅⋅*Clone this repo
⋅⋅*npm install to install all req'd dependencies
⋅⋅*npm start to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)
